### This is a templified verision of Louisa Barrett's Resume Theme with a few modifications:

- I wasnt a fan of the way the education was listed with dates after the description so I moved them up to the top behind any majors if any.
- In refererence to the above, there is a Jade mixin for creating experience there is a variable (title) used for job descriptions. It is also used for major/degree designation.
- Erring on the side of caution, I stripped out some of Louisa's personal information, I didn't know if it was 'filler text' or not, I don't think I need to explain that. 
- Replaced images with Font-Awesome Icons
